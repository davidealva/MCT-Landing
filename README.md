# Rails 4 Viral Campaign Pre Launcher

I rolled this Rails 4.2 app for my personal album launch using Rails, PostgreSQL, Digital Ocean, & Dokku.

# PRELAUNCHER

I've upgraded to Rails 4.2 version of Harry's prelaunchr with updated design, comfortable control panel, and other new advanced features. Based on https://github.com/harrystech/prelaunchr and discussed in greater detail on [Tim Ferriss'](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email/) blog.

You can see how it live deployed on Digital Ocean with a Dokku app
